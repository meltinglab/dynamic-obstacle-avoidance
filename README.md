## 1. Description

The basic idea behind our project is to implement a system for dynamic obstacle avoidance using an adaptive Model Predictive Control. 
In the simulated environment, the vehicle model is expected to encounter and safely avoid the dynamic obstacles along its way. 
When an obstacle is not present ahead of the autonomous vehicle, it is expected to follow a predetermined path.
